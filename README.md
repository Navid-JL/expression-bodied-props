## Features

**Automated expression-bodied property creation: This extension provides two code snippets (prope and propef) that allow you to quickly generate expression-bodied properties in C#. Simply type the snippet prefix, press Enter, and the code is generated for you.**

**Customizable field name: The propef snippet also generates a private field for the property, with a customizable name. This makes it easy to create and name the backing field without having to write out the full property definition manually.**

**Improved code readability: By using expression-bodied properties, your code can become more concise and easier to read, reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write and maintain.**

**Increased productivity: With the ability to generate code quickly and easily, you can save time and increase your productivity when working on C# projects.**

**Simplifies property creation: Instead of manually writing out the code for an expression-bodied property, you can use the snippets provided by this extension to simplify the process and reduce the chance of errors.**
